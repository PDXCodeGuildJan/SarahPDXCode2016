	<section><p>Music. A type of communication that can be understood by anyone, no matter the age, the language you speak, the place you live or the culture you come from. Now, more than ever, research is being conducted on the importance of music to enhance your quality of life and why that is so. Music can evolve by the process of natural selection, the same way species evolve in the natural world. This doesn't mean that you have to be able to play instruments to recieve the benefits of music, you don't even need to be creative.</p></section>

	<section><h2><center>It Starts with Children</center></h3> 
	<p> Everyone who has learned their ABCs knows that it is easier to memorize a list if it is set to music. Scientific research supports common experience that pairing music with rhythm and pitch enhances learning and recall. Music helps children and adolescents with attention problems in several ways. First, it can be used as a reward for desired behavior. For example, for paying attention to homework for 10 minutes, a child can be rewarded with the opportunity to listen to music for 5 minutes. Second, it can be used to help enhance attention to “boring” academic tasks such as memorization, using songs, rhythms, and dance or movement to enhance the interest of the lists to be memorized. Instrumental baroque music is great for improving attention and reasoning. For students, playing background music is not distracting. Third, musical cues can be used to help organize activities – one kind of music for one activity (studying), another for a different activity (eating), and a third kind for heading to bed. Fourth, studies show that calming music can promote pro-social behavior and decrease impulsive behavior. Don't believe me? Just ask the folks at <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Pages/Music-and-Mood.aspx">HealthyChildren.org</a> They know what they are talking about. <p></section>

	<section><h2><center>Music as Therapy</center></h2>
	<p> This music research aligns with the larger arena of music therapy, defined by the American Music Therapy Association as "the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals."

	Music therapy has been used for centuries as a way to restore energy, improve mood, and even help the body heal more naturally.

	Dr. Frank Lipman, founder and director of Eleven-Eleven Wellness Center in New York City and a pioneer in integrative and functional medicine, recommends musical time-outs as a way to calm your body and brain with soothing rhythms and to slow down your heart rate and help you breathe easier. You know what else helps you breathe easier? A page about Corgi's and how adorably hilarious they are. I would recommend this <a href="corgi.html">one</a>.

	<p>According to researchers, music affects our mood in a variety of ways. But at the base of the phenomenon is rhythm and tone.

	When we listen to a rhythm, our heart actually begins to synch with it. A slow heartbeat with a strong diastolic pressure tells our brain that something sad or depressing is occurring. Very fast beating is obviously related to excitement, whereas a dreamy rhythm with occasional upbeats can signify love or joy.

	Tones are equally important as rhythm. A major key music piece signifies cheerful communication to our brain, while minor key pieces closely mirror the sighs and soft keenings of lamentation.

	This all has a powerful effect on our brain, which directs our psyche to actually feel what’s being communicated to us.</p>
